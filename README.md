# Movies-app
Movies-app with json-server


A ReactJS  front-end that consumes the movies.json from json-server  and their sources, and displays them in UI Note : Download the movies-app.zip file and extract it. and open command Prompt, and change to that source code directory.

One command to get setup - Type npm install to download all required modules.
One command to get started - Type npm start to start development in your default browser. and another terminal and run 
      $ json-server -p 3006 -w movies.json
      
To run json-server.

No more JavaScript fatigue - I used the most popular and powerful libraries for working with React.
For production build - Type npm run build to do all this:
For Test Scripts - Type npm test to do all this
